### **Test Series 1: September 2024 Period**
#### **Backtesting Performance: Limit Strategy**

The Limit Strategy introduces risk management rules (e.g., stop-loss and trailing stops) to the trades initiated by the model's triggers. A "hit" is recorded if a predicted trigger results in a profit of more than 5 basis points.

| Model | Total Trades | Successful Trades (Hits) | Precision of Performance | Total Profit/Loss (Points) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **HI 83** | 35 | 18 | 0.514 | 458,4 |
| **LO 83** | 25 | 13 | 0.520 | 261,2 |
| **HI 50** | 21 | 15 | 0.714 | 362,0 |
| **LO 50** | 16 | 8 | 0.500 | 124,5 |

**Analysis:** The analysis of the Limit Strategy reveals a noteworthy trade-off between precision and volume. The HI 50 model achieved a very high 'Precision of Performance' of 71.4%, yet its total profit of 362.0 points was lower than the 458.4 points generated by the HI 83 model. This difference is attributable to the number of trades executedâ€”35 by the HI 83 model versus 21 by the HI 50 model. This indicates that a higher frequency of identified triggers can lead to greater overall profit. Furthermore, both models saw a significant improvement in profitability with the Limit Strategy compared to the Base Strategy.

### **Test Series 2: October-November 2024 Period**
#### **Backtesting Performance: Limit Strategy**

The second, more extensive test series covers 19 trading days from October 18, 2024, to November 27, 2024\. This series compares models trained on 67 and 50 days of data.

| Model | Total Trades | Successful Trades (Hits) | Precision of Performance | Total Profit/Loss (Points) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **HI 67** | 107 | 48 | 0.449 | 1119,3 |
| **LO 67** | 70 | 37 | 0.529 | 669,2 |
| **HI 50** | 68 | 29 | 0.426 | 525 |
| **LO 50** | 67 | 24 | 0.358 | 482,7 |

#### **Backtesting Performance: Limit Strategy***

**Analysis:** The Limit Strategy again proved highly effective, substantially increasing the profitability for all models. The HI 67 model achieved the highest total profit with 1119,3 points, with 450 point distance to the next model. The 67-day models generated higher returns with the Limit Strategy, suggesting their higher number of initiated trades created more opportunities for the risk management rules to generate profit. The Precision of Performance was comparable across all models in this scenario.
